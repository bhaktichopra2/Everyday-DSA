# Everyday-DSA

--- 

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python and Java. I’ve completed 70+ problems so far, and this is an ongoing project as I continue to practice and improve.

The goal is to stay consistent, strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews by solving problems in multiple languages.

What’s inside:
1. 70+ DSA problems (and growing)
2. Solutions in Python and Java
3. Topics include arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, sorting, hashing, and more
